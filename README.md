# Flask-Postgresql-Nginx

This a simple web application where I have used docker-compose to build my application. To run this application, run the following,

```
docker-compose up --build
```
add the domain name in your ```/etc/hosts```

for example:

```
192.168.122.200    flaskapp.com
```
Then open your browser and use the simple basic multi-container-based web application.
